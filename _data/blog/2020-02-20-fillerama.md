## Where is Timor Leste

Timor is a small island at the southern end of Maritime Southeast Asia and in the north of the Timor Sea. The island is divided between the sovereign states of East Timor on the eastern part and Indonesia on the western part. Leste is a Portuguese name for the word of the east in English.

## Timor Leste  Overview

Emerging from decades of conflict, Timor-Leste became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century in May 2002.

Faced with the task of rebuilding public infrastructure – including roads, ports and airports, water and sanitation systems, and government facilities – and institutional frameworks, Timor-Leste has made significant progress in key areas since independence. Meanwhile, fragility remains a challenge as the country contends with legacies of past conflict.

Today, with a population of 1.3 million people, Timor-Leste is a peaceful, democratic nation. While poverty levels remain high, progress has been made in improving living standards. The proportion of Timorese living in poverty declined from 50% in 2007 to an estimated 42% in 2014.

Investments in human capital are directly linked to Timor-Leste’s future growth, productivity, and competitiveness. In 2017, the Human Capital Index for Timor-Leste stood at 0.43, as compared to the East Asia and the Pacific’s regional average of 0.61. A healthier and more skilled workforce is necessary to better meet the future labor demands across the economy.

## **Industrial Opportunities in Timor Leste**

The opportunities are obvious that the infrastructure of East Timor is pending improvement. What’s more, the Timorese government is planning to spend more on infrastructure in a few years to come.

Agriculture is also a promising industry if you plan to invest in Timor Leste. the most promising produces should be coffee, coconuts, beans, corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, etc.

The fishing industry is also undeveloped, despite that it has plenty of marine resources. Thus, the processing of marine produces has huge market potential.

At last, let’s take a look at its tourism. Tourism is based on the development of the primary industry and secondary industry. But nowadays, the said two still have a long way to go. But, we have to admit that Timor Leste has huge natural resources in terms of tourism. Green mountains, nice beaches, blue sky, fantastic diving position, and natural animals are laying the foundation of developing tourism in Timor Leste.

Compared with the booming e-commerce in countries surrounding, the same industry in Timor Leste is already lagging. There’re already [Shopee](https://www.shopee.com/), [Lazada](http://www.lazada.com/) and other e-commerce platforms in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore. But right now, the websites and apps are still countable with only 2 hands. Moreover, the number of e-commerce apps is declining from 2013 to 2015. E-Commerce will be a promising industry in Timor Leste, but with few years to foster.
